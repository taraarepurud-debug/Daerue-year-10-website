    <p>I have many things that I myself play!!! I'm quite the gamer so I'd be glad if i could have any suggestions on what games i should play either on steam, console, or any device that includes games I can play!! either way I'll show you what im interested in!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I like playing a lot of tf2! (short for team fortress 2 btw) been playing it for a few weeks and my main is spy! i like his butterfly knife and I like damage surfing in the air. Sometimes I always think about getting a backstab while falling down to a unsuspecting person down below, not knowing that I'm above them ready to backstab them lmao</p>

    <p>I also play roblox! but I quited playing it because it's in a serious situation, (do not harass the developers of said game even if it's as bad, it's important that you shouldn't) but you can also search up the latest drama to catch up to date whats going on. we're getting off track, lets get back on topic- I used to play alot of shooter/fps style games, and also some survival horror and basic horror too!! but recently they're been just a lot less of them and more cash grab games that the gameplay itself is just boring. but i have some recommendations though! </p>
    <br>
    <p>here some are the recommendations if you're stuck on what to play! </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Die of Death</li> 
     <li>Combat initiation</li>
     <li>forsaken, it's og of Die of death. DOD is a inspersion of forsaken</li>
     <li>dummies versus noobs</li>
     <li>outcome memories (very very age muture, would recommend ages 13 to play it)</li>
     <li>helmet(a second game of dummies versus noobs from the same creator!)</li>
     <li>jujutsu shenanigans</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>ULTRAKILL</h1>
    <p>As the name inplies, theres ultra and theres Killing.Ultrakill is Fps, fast, and first person shooter! It contains alot of gore but it can be easily be turned off in settings for you young adults.The main dev Hakita made ultrakill, with him making (almost) all of the orginal sound track, ANNNDDD he's a VERY silly pal ;). The story goes in ultrakill, that all of humanity is dead from a massive war that lasted for hundreds of years through out it, and the only left standing on earth are only blood thirsty machines that were made from humanity to continue war (the robots are fueled by blood so thats why i said blood thirsty) and you are a robot named V1, a robot who feeds on blood that was mysteriously got sent straight to H,e double hocky sticks. And now you're roaming down the layers of hekk searching for more BLOOD</p>
    <p>(sadly i do not have an images from ultrakill, BUTTTT you can buy it on steam for 30 bucks, trust me its worth the money for something so cool)</p>
