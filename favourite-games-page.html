    <p>I have many things that I myself play!!! I'm quite the gamer so I'd be glad if i could have any suggestions on what games i should play either on steam, console, or any device that includes games I can play!! either way I'll show you what im interested in!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I like playing a lot of tf2! (short for team fortress 2 btw) been playing it for a few weeks and my main is spy! i like his butterfly knife and I like damage surfing in the air. Sometimes I always think about getting a backstab while falling down to a unsuspecting person down below, not knowing that I'm above them ready to backstab them lmao</p>
