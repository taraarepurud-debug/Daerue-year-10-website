    <p>I have many things that I myself play!!! I'm quite the gamer so I'd be glad if i could have any suggestions on what games i should play either on steam, console, or any device that includes games I can play!! either way I'll show you what im interested in!</p>
    <br>
    <p>I like playing a lot of tf2! (short for team fortress 2 btw) been playing it for a few weeks and my main is spy! i like his butterfly knife and I like damage surfing in the air. Sometimes I always think about getting a backstab while falling down to a unsuspecting person down below, not knowing that I'm above them ready to backstab them lmao</p>

    <p>I also play roblox! but I quited playing it because it's in a serious situation, (do not harass the developers of said game even if it's as bad, it's important that you shouldn't) but you can also search up the latest drama to catch up to date whats going on. we're getting off track, lets get back on topic- I used to play alot of shooter/fps style games, and also some survival horror and basic horror too!! but recently they're been just a lot less of them and more cash grab games that the gameplay itself is just boring. but i have some recommendations though! </p>
    <br>
    <p>here some are the recommendations if you're stuck on what to play! </p>
    <ul>
     <li>Die of Death</li> 
     <li>Combat initiation</li>
     <li>forsaken, it's og of Die of death. DOD is a inspersion of forsaken</li>
     <li>dummies versus noobs</li>
     <li></li>
    </ul>
